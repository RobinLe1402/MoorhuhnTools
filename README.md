# Moorhuhn-Tools

multiple of the Moorhuhn (Crazy Chicken) games.

## MH3Extract

## MHJnRExtract

## Development history

This application was originally developed as part of my
[`tools`](https://rle.sh/git-repo/tools) repository. However, as time
moved on I decided to split that repository up into one repository for
each application it contained. And I actively decided against keeping
the file history because...

- all applications had a very short development time with few commits;
- all new repositories would have the commits of all other applications
  too;
- when I decided to split the repository, I also updated the source code
  to match my new default repository structure and to be more efficient;
- functionally, all applications were finished at that time, so I
  wouldn't have to look at previous revisions.

Hence, I decided to do a fresh start for all the tools.
